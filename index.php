			<h2>My Dream</h2>
			<p>I'd like to end up as an animator or a game designer. I love making things and learning new kinds of artistic media and software.</p>

			<h2>Right Now</h2>
			<p>Outside of academic work, I invest time in <span class="highlight">photography, animation, art, and music</span>. I enjoy studying computer science because of its potential in creative projects, especially for its role in <span class="highlight">computer software and animation</span>. I also enjoy <span class="highlight">web programming and web design</span>.</p>
