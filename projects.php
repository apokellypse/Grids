			<!-- <h2>PleaseCall App</h2>
			<h3>Bloomberg Hackathon Feb 2014</h3>
			<p>I worked with Junia George, Dashiell Brown, Leon Zaruvinsky, and Keshav Verma to produce our app titled "PleaseCall".
			<p>I did some UI design using XML and worked on some of the database using MySQL. Most of my time was spent studying the Android documentation and learning how to use Git.</p>
 -->
			<h2>Team ShortFilm</h2>
			<p>As part of a Computer Graphics Practicum, my team, <a href="#">Team ShortFilm</a>, used Autodesk Maya's Python API to export Maya Scenes into a framework that would then render the scenes with our custom shaders and lights.</p>

			<h2>Pokemon Showdown</h2>
			<p>For the final project in CS 3110, my partner and I implemented the model and controller for <a href="#">Pokemon Showdown</a> in OCaml.</p>

			<h2>Impulse</h2>
			<p>For Introductory Game Design, my team created a game called <a href="#">Impulse</a>, a novel action-platformer that allows players to "pulse" off platforms to escape radioactive substances and monsters.</p>

			<h2>Lord of the Cache</h2>
			<p>For CS 3410, my partner and I created a bot for the <a href="#">Lord of the Cache</a> class competition, in which each bot aims to write to memory the fastest, and to inhibit the opponent from doing the same.</p>

			<h2>CritterWorld</h2>
			<!-- <h3>CS 2112, Spring 2014</h3> -->
			<p>I worked on this project with my class partner Charlie Qian. The last four assignments in CS 2112 cumulate into a giant project known as CritterWorld.</p>
			<p>CritterWorld involved <span class="highlight">parsing &amp; fault injection</span>, <span class="highlight">interpreters</span>, <span class="highlight">working with Java GUIs and FXML</span>, and <span class="highlight">networks</span>.</p>
