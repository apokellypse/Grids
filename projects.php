			<!-- <h2>PleaseCall App</h2>
			<h3>Bloomberg Hackathon Feb 2014</h3>
			<p>I worked with Junia George, Dashiell Brown, Leon Zaruvinsky, and Keshav Verma to produce our app titled "PleaseCall".
			<p>I did some UI design using XML and worked on some of the database using MySQL. Most of my time was spent studying the Android documentation and learning how to use Git.</p>
 -->
			<h2>Team ShortFilm</h2>
			<p>As part of Computer Graphics Practicum (CS 4621), my team, <a href="#">Team ShortFilm</a>, used <span class="highlight">Autodesk Maya's Python API</span> to export Maya Scenes into a framework that would then render the scenes with our <span class="highlight">custom shaders and lights</span>.</p>

			<h2>Pokemon Showdown</h2>
			<p>For the final project in CS 3110, my partner and I implemented the model and controller for <a href="#">Pokemon Showdown</a> in OCaml.</p>

			<h2>Impulse</h2>
			<p>For Introductory Game Design (CS 3152), my team created a game called <a href="#">Impulse</a>, <span class="highlight">a novel action-platformer</span> that allows players to "pulse" off platforms to escape radioactive substances and monsters.</p>

			<h2>Lord of the Cache</h2>
			<p>For CS 3410, my partner and I created a bot for the <a href="#">Lord of the Cache</a> class competition, in which each bot aims to <span class="highlight">write to memory</span> the fastest, and to inhibit the opponent from doing the same.</p>

			<h2>CritterWorld</h2>
			<!-- <h3>CS 2112, Spring 2014</h3> -->
			<p>For the final project for CS 2112, my partner and I created a critter simulator known as CritterWorld. The critters have rules which dictate how they mutate, attack, mate, eat, spawn, and die.</p>
			<p>CritterWorld involved <span class="highlight">parsing &amp; fault injection</span>, <span class="highlight">interpreters</span>, <span class="highlight">working with Java GUIs and FXML</span>, and <span class="highlight">networks</span>.</p>

			<h2>Websites</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><p>A summer project for my club, <a target="_blank" href="http://cornellanimation.com">Cornell Computer Animation</a></p></li>
			<!-- <p>I designed the website, which you can view <a href="http://cornellanimation.com">here</a>.</p> -->
				<li><p>I made several versions of my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/apokellypse/apokellypse-dot-com">Personal Website</a> when I was starting out in web design.</p></li>
				<li><p><a target="_blank" href="http://cornellmeasureless.com">Cornell Measureless</a> was our client for CS 1300.</p></li>
				<li><p><a href="#">FNDY EMS Pipes and Drums</a> was our client for CS 2300.</p></li>
			</ul>

			<h2>BrickBreaker</h2>
			<!-- <h3>CS 1110, Fall 2013</h3> -->
			<p>I implemented the game BrickBreaker with my partner Victoria Beall. It was my first taste of the <span class="highlight">MVC design pattern</span>.</p>
