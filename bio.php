		<h1>Bio</h1>
		<article>
			<h2>My Dream</h2>
			<p>is to be an animator or a game designer. I love making things and learning new kinds of artistic media and software.</p>

			<h2>Right Now</h2>
			<p>I'm learning tons in the Computer Science Major at Cornell, with plans to do a Game Design and/or Fine Arts Minor. I think Code and Creativity go hand in hand, and try to exercise that in my hobby of making websites.</p>
